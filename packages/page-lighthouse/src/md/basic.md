# Lighthouse 

Welcome to the lighthouse module. Here you can see an overview of all the lighthouses on the network and participate in the network either a collation (running a node that helps to propose blocks of the network).

Collators earn rewards at the end of each month by the team. The rewards are split between the collators, in proportion to the amount blocks produced.
